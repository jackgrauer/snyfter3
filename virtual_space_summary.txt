Virtual Space Block Selection - Complete!

The block selection now works anywhere in the editor space, including:

1. BEYOND LINE ENDINGS - Select rectangular areas past the end of lines
2. VIRTUAL LINES - Select on lines that don't exist yet (below the file)
3. TRUE RECTANGLES - Draw any rectangle anywhere, regardless of text

KEY FEATURES:
• Click and drag anywhere to create block selections
• Selection shows as blue highlight even in empty space
• Copy (Ctrl+C) pads with spaces when selecting virtual space
• Preserves exact rectangular shape regardless of line lengths

EXAMPLE USE CASES:
• Align comments at column 80 even if lines are shorter
• Select rectangular regions for columnar data manipulation
• Copy/paste rectangular blocks maintaining exact spacing
• Create perfectly aligned text blocks

The selection is now truly geometry-based rather than text-based,
making it work like a drawing tool for rectangular text regions.
